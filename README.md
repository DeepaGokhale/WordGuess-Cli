# WordGuess-Cli

So this is a hangman game - you get no of attemps to play and guess a word.

I have used some of the famours movies (1940-2019) Some are acamademy award winners and others just my favorite. You get twice many guesses to the letters that exist in the word you are guessing

for e.g. "Bombay" would give you 12 chances to guess the word

I have some screenshots and video attached for the demo
